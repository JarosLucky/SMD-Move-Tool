# SMD-Move-Tool

This tool was made for the needs of **[SGM ãƒ„](https://steamcommunity.com/id/officialsgm/)**
To be more specific for high-polygonal car models, under the task to organize the materials so that later you can replace them through the API lua in Garry's Mod.
Arrangement was necessary because with **[hacked StudioMDL from Cra0kalo](https://dev.cra0kalo.com/?p=21)** there is an opportunity to significantly get used to the limits, for which was designed API lua

Usage is quite simple and with hints at each step. It's easier to run it and see that than try to find a description of how to interact with this tool somewhere else.
